====Compilation===
To compile the project, go to the "Compile" folder and run "compile.sh".<br>
If you want to compile it manually, do the following:<br>
<br>
1. Create a folder in project's root, let's say "build". <br>
2. cd into it.<br>
3. Invoke the command "cmake ../".<br>
4. Invoke the command "make -j2". <br>
5. An executable sdltest will appear in build folder. :) <br>
